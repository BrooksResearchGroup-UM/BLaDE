### BLaDE is a Basic Lambda Dynamics Engine for molecular dynamics based alchemical free energy calculations using multisite lambda dynamics on graphical processor units.
### BLaDe was developed within the Brooks Research Group at the University of Michigan and is currently overseen by [Ryan Hayes at the University of California, Irvine](https://github.com/RyanLeeHayes).
### To download the BLaDe GitHub repository (housed on Ryan's site) execute the command: `git clone git@github.com:RyanLeeHayes/BLaDE.git`.
### BLaDe is also fully integrated and distributed as part of the [CHARMM/pyCHARMM](https://charmm.chemistry.harvard.edu/main.php) software availble free of charge for academic and government laboratories.
